    "**The sentence means that when we perform a statistical test, we are trying to make conclusions about the entire population, not just the specific sample we collected data from.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Here's how the terms relate to this idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 𝑥ᵢ (Individual data points): These are the values you get from each observation in your sample. For example, if you're measuring people's heights, each person's height is an 𝑥ᵢ.\n",
    "2. 𝑥̄ (Sample mean): This is the average of all the individual data points (𝑥ᵢ's) in your sample. It summarizes the sample, but it doesn't tell you the true average (mean) of the entire population.\n",
    "3. 𝜇 (Population mean): This is the true average of the entire population, which we don't usually know. We use the sample to estimate it.\n",
    "4. 𝜇₀ (Hypothesized population mean): This is the value we propose in our null hypothesis. It represents what we assume to be the population mean before collecting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple terms, the test result tells us if we have enough evidence to make a conclusion about the population's true average (𝜇), based on the sample data (𝑥ᵢ and 𝑥̄), rather than just describing the sample itself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**From my own understanding: When we perform a statistical test, we’re typically not interested in just the sample we measure (the small group we collected data from), but rather in drawing conclusions about the population (the larger group we care about). The sample gives us an estimate, but we’re ultimately making statements about the population.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Terms in the specific case:\n",
    " - 𝑥𝑖 (xi): These are the individual exam scores of the 50 students in our sample. For example, if one student scores 85, that’s an 𝑥𝑖 value.\n",
    "\n",
    " - 𝑥¯ (x̄): This is the sample mean, or the average score of the 50 students in our sample. Let’s say the average exam score in our sample is 75. This is 𝑥¯. It gives us a sense of how students in our sample performed on average.\n",
    "\n",
    " - 𝜇 (mu): This is the population mean, or the true average exam score of all students (not just the 50 in our sample, but all students who might use the new teaching method). We usually don’t know 𝜇 because we can’t measure every student’s score. The goal of our hypothesis test is to make an inference about 𝜇 based on our sample.\n",
    "\n",
    " - 𝜇₀ (mu₀): This is the hypothesized population mean we assume to be true before testing. In this case, it might be the average exam score using the old teaching method. Suppose we believe the average score under the old method is 70. This is 𝜇₀, the benchmark we’re testing against.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**When the sentence says \"the outcome of the test refers to the population parameter,\" it means that even though we calculate and work with the sample mean (x̄ = 75), we’re using it to draw conclusions about the population mean (𝜇). We’re not just interested in the 50 students we sampled; we want to know if the new teaching method will improve scores for all students. In this case, our statistical test would compare the sample mean (x̄ = 75) to the hypothesized population mean (𝜇₀ = 70). If the difference is statistically significant, we might conclude that the population mean (𝜇) for all students is likely higher than 70, meaning the new teaching method works better than the old one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, the statistical test helps us make a statement about the population mean (𝜇), based on our sample mean (x̄). Even though we only have data from a sample, the result we’re interested in applies to the entire population, not just the sample itself.**\n",

    "**A smaller p-value makes the null hypothesis look more \"ridiculous\" because it shows that the chance of observing the data we collected (or something even more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true is very small. In other words, the smaller the p-value, the more unlikely it is that our observed results happened by random chance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the breakdown of the technical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- p-value: This is a number that tells us the probability of getting our observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- Null hypothesis (H₀): This is the starting assumption in a test, where we assume there is no effect or no difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, if the p-value is really small, it suggests that the assumption of \"no effect\" (the null hypothesis) doesn't fit well with the data we actually observed. The smaller the p-value, the more it makes the null hypothesis seem implausible or \"ridiculous,\" pushing us to reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis (which suggests there is an effect).**\n",
    "\n",
    "From my own words that are easy to understand in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A p-value is a measure in statistics that helps us determine the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For example, imagine you’re flipping a coin, and you expect the coin to be fair (i.e., heads and tails should each show up 50% of the time). This expectation represents the null hypothesis. Now, let’s say you flip the coin 100 times and get 90 heads and 10 tails. You calculate a p-value to see how likely it is to get such a result if the coin were truly fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A large p-value means the result you observed (90 heads and 10 tails) isn’t very surprising—it could reasonably happen by chance, even if the coin is fair. But a small p-value means that getting a result this extreme would be extremely rare if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, the smaller the p-value, the more unlikely it is that the null hypothesis (the coin is fair) could explain what you're seeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, let’s apply this logic to the phrase \"a smaller p-value makes the null hypothesis look more ridiculous.\" When the p-value is very small, it suggests that the data you observed (like getting 90 heads in 100 flips) would rarely happen if the null hypothesis were correct. It becomes harder and harder to believe that the null hypothesis is true. In fact, the smaller the p-value, the more \"ridiculous\" it seems to hold on to the idea that nothing unusual is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Think of it this way may be better, If you keep getting evidence (data) that contradicts what the null hypothesis predicts, your confidence in the null hypothesis will naturally decrease. A small p-value is a signal that the observed data is so unlikely under the null hypothesis that you should consider rejecting it.\n",

When we get a very small p-value, it’s like seeing something so unexpected under the null hypothesis that we seriously question whether the null hypothesis is even reasonable anymore.

    "Based on the text and the table in the image, it seems you are being asked to simulate a p-value to evaluate the evidence against the null hypothesis (H₀), which claims that people have no preference for tilting their heads left or right while kissing (a 50/50 chance, similar to a coin flip).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to interpret this situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Observed Data: In the study, 80 out of 124 couples (about 64.5%) tilted their heads to the right, which is significantly different from the expected 50% if there were no preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating a p-value: A p-value can be simulated by assuming the null hypothesis (no head tilt preference, i.e., a 50/50 split) and then checking how likely it is to observe 64.5% or more couples tilting to the right. This can be done by flipping a \"50/50 coin\" many times (each representing one couple's head tilt) and seeing how often you get results like 64.5% tilting to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the p-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is high (greater than 0.1), it means that getting this result is quite likely under the null hypothesis, so there's no strong evidence against it.\n",
    "If the p-value is low (less than 0.05), it suggests that the result is unlikely under the null hypothesis, giving us reason to question it and possibly favor the alternative hypothesis (that there is a preference for tilting to the right).\n",
    "Based on the percentages and evidence table in the image, the lower the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. To fully simulate the p-value, you would need to run a statistical simulation or use statistical software to compute how often you would expect to see results as extreme as 64.5% under a 50/50 head tilt assumption."

    "### Fisher's Tea Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "A most beloved piece of [statistical lore](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2012.00620.x) about the (most famous) statistician Ronald Fisher involves cups of tea with milk. Fisher and his friend and colleague, Dr. Muriel Bristol, worked at Cambridge in the 1920s and regularly had tea together. During one of their afternoon tea times, Bristol refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring in the tea. Bristol said she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea when the milk was poured in afterward the tea. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk added in first and 4 with tea added in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first. As it turned out, Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether there was evidence against an assumption of Bristol just randomly guessing), and subsequently designed a statistical hypothesis test to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you run an experiment like this with students in STA130. You get a random sample of 80 STA130 students to each taste one cup of tea and tell you whether they think the milk or tea was poured first. **Suppose 49 students are able to correctly state which was poured first.** Provide a statistical analysis of this experiment as guided through the following set of questions.\n",

    "- The analysis here could be approached from the perspective of formal hypothesis testing.\n",
    "    - which would likely involve the simulation of a sampling distribution under $H_0$ in order to estimate p-value with respect to the null hypothesis based on the observed test statistic (how?), concluding with the assement of $H_0$ based on an interpretation of the meaning of the p-value relative to $H_0$\n",

    "# Problem Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Relationship between this experiment and the original with Fisher and Bristol**\n",
    "\n",
    "**While the structure of the experiments is similar in the sense that both aim to test whether individuals can discern whether tea or milk was poured first, there are several key differences between the original experiment and the one with STA130 students:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample Size: Fisher’s experiment with Dr. Bristol involved 8 trials, while this experiment involves 80 participants. A larger sample size provides more power to detect whether the observed results are due to chance or represent a real effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Population: In Fisher's experiment, the population of interest was quite specific—Dr. Bristol’s individual ability to discern the tea preparation order. In contrast, this experiment looks at a more general population of students, who may not have as strong a preference or ability to distinguish between the two methods. This difference in population could influence the parameter we are estimating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Personalized vs Abstract Parameter: Dr. Bristol’s ability was a unique, personalized skill, which may or may not generalize to other people. The parameter in this experiment is more abstract—it reflects the general ability of a random sample of students to distinguish between tea preparation methods, which may be less personalized but more representative of a larger group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, while the two experiments test the same kind of ability, the context, sample size, and population of interest are different, requiring slightly different considerations in terms of analysis and interpretation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Statements of the Null Hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Null Hypothesis (H₀):The null hypothesis is that the students are randomly guessing whether the milk or tea was poured first. In other words, the proportion of students who correctly identify the order of pouring is no different from 50%, which would be the expected success rate if they were guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formal Statement:H0​:p=0.5 Where p represents the proportion of students in the population who can correctly identify the order of pouring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Informal Interpretation: The students are just guessing, and we would expect around 50% of them to correctly identify whether the tea or milk was poured first, just by chance. The observed result of 49 correct out of 80 is no more than what we would expect if they had no real ability to distinguish the pouring order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):The alternative hypothesis is that more than 50% of the students can correctly identify whether the milk or tea was poured first, suggesting that they are not simply guessing but have some genuine ability to distinguish between the two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formal Statement:HA​:p>0.5 Where p represents the proportion of students in the population who can correctly identify the order of pouring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Informal Interpretation: More than 50% of students can correctly identify whether the tea or milk was poured first, indicating that they have some ability to distinguish the order beyond mere guessing. The observed success rate of 49 out of 80 may be evidence of this ability."

The observed proportion is 49 out of 80 students, or 0.6125. We test this using a one-sided binomial test, where the null hypothesis assumes that students are guessing (p = 0.5).\n",

    "# Conclusion regarding the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the adapted version of Fisher's Tea Experiment with the STA130 students, a one-sided test is used because the hypothesis we are testing focuses on whether the students are better than chance at identifying the order of pouring. Specifically, the alternative hypothesis (H₁) is that more than 50% of students can correctly identify the order, implying an improvement over random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-sided test would be used if we were interested in testing for any difference from 50%, either better or worse. However, in this case, we are only interested in whether the students are doing better than chance (i.e., more than 50% correct identifications), which justifies the use of a one-sided test. We are not concerned with whether they are doing worse than chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we tested the hypothesis that STA130 students are randomly guessing whether milk or tea was poured first when presented with a cup of tea. The null hypothesis assumed that students have no real ability to distinguish the order of pouring, and thus would correctly identify the order about 50% of the time by chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted a one-sided binomial test to evaluate whether the observed proportion of correct identifications (49 out of 80 students, or 0.6125) is significantly greater than what we would expect under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**P-value: The p-value calculated from the one-sided binomial test was 0.0283, which is less than the conventional significance level of 0.05.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. This means that the observed result of 49 correct identifications out of 80 is unlikely to have occurred by chance if the students were simply guessing. There is statistically significant evidence to suggest that more than 50% of the students in the sample can correctly identify whether milk or tea was poured first.Hence, we conclude that the data provides evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is likely that STA130 students, as a group, have some ability to distinguish the order of pouring, and the result is not merely due to random guessing. However, this conclusion is specific to this sample of students, and further testing would be required to generalize these findings to broader populations."

    "In our discussion, we explored the key concepts of statistical testing, including the importance of measurability, the criteria for a good null hypothesis, and the distinction between null and alternative hypotheses. We emphasized that when calculating a p-value, we assume the null hypothesis is true to assess how likely the observed data would occur by chance. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. We then applied these concepts to an adaptation of Fisher’s Tea Experiment, where 80 STA130 students were asked to identify whether tea or milk was poured first, with 49 correctly identifying the order. The null hypothesis assumed students were guessing (50% success rate), and a one-sided binomial test was used to calculate a p-value of 0.0283, suggesting that students had a real ability to distinguish the pouring order. This result led us to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the students’ success rate was unlikely to be due to random guessing.\n",

    "### Ethical Professionalism Considerations\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using p-values and hypothesis testing appropriately is an important ethical and professional responsibility of anyone doing data analysis. Actually, there is quite the quiet Contra-Versy (or is it Con-TROV-ersy?) around p-values. First, on a general level, it seems quite clear that p-values and hypothesis testing methodologies MUST play some ongoing contributing role in the so-called \"replication crisis\" rampantly afflicting mordern science; namely, \"significant findings\" made in scientific studies are not able to be reproduced by future studies at an alarming rate; and, this whole paradigm of \"significant findings\" is based on p-values and hypothesis testing... so, something's going on with this methodology in some way...\n",
    "    \n",
    "More specifically however, p-values are themselves quite problematic. To see this, just briefly consider the following article titles...\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Why are p-values controversial?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1277161) \n",
    "- [What a nerdy debate about p-values shows about science and how to fix it](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005)\n",
    "- [The reign of the p-value is over: what alternative analyses could we employ to fill the power vacuum?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0174)\n",
    "- [Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9)\n",
    "- [Statistics experts urge scientists to rethink the p-value](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/statistics-experts-urge-scientists-rethink-p-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the issues here are relatively advanced and subtle (as introduced [here](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~berger/p-values.html), presented [here](https://www.jarad.me/courses/stat587Eng/slides/Inference/I06-Pvalues/why_pvalues_dont_mean_what_you_think_they_mean.pdf), and demonstrated using simulation [here](https://jaradniemi.shinyapps.io/pvalue/)), the problem essentially comes down to the fact that most scientists (or just people) don't know how to really interpret the numeric value of a p-value. There are therefore two current proposed solutions to address this challenge.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Just interpreting p-values using the follwing table (which really isn't that hard, so it's surprising that this solution isn't more broadly adopted...)\n",

    "|$$0.001 \\ge p$$|Very strong evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only do **hypothesis testing** on the basis of confidence intervals, not **p-values** (which might be the best solution wherever doing so is a realistic, convenient  possibility...)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this quite broad introductory context in mind, what does your favorite ChatBot thinks about the following statements? \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Hypothesis testing is not a \"mathematical proof\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We do not prove $H_0$ false, we instead give evidence against the $H_0$: \"We reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ, meaning we have ABC evidence against the null hypothesis\"\n",
    "    2. We do not prove $H_0$ is true, we instead do not have evidence to reject $H_0$: \"We fail to reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implying that a \"non-significant result\" means there is \"no effect\" misleads an audience because this may in actual fact simply indicate that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So this therefore overlooks the possibility of sample size limitations, or Type II errors (which means a test incorrectly concludes that there is no effect or difference when, in fact, there is one). \n",
    "    \n",
    "> Similarly, analagously, a \"significant result\" used to reject the null hypothsis could alternatively be a Type I error (which means a test actually incorrectly rejected a null hypothesis when it was actually true)... we're only providing a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis... but the evidence could still incorrectly suggest the wrong conclusion... it really depends on how strong the evidence is...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - all of which is why just interpreting p-values using the table above is a good idea...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The p-values used for hypothesis testing are contructed upone the assumptions of the null hypotheses they correspond to; but, null hypotheses are actually often presented in simple forms that routinely hide a lot of information that is implicitly used to construct the p-values. For example, distributional assumptions about the population, estimated \"plug-in\" values that can used to simplify the problem calculations, and the reliance upon \"random sampling\", etc...<br><br>\n",
    "           \n",
    "4. Drawing overly broad conclusions, or making recommendations based on findings that reject the null hypothesis in a specific context is fraught with the problematic risks of overgeneralization errors. Further exacerbating this issue, null hypotheses are typically so called \"point null hypotheses\" which is meant to emphasize that they are mathematically increadibly sharply specific; whereas, alternative hypotheses are usually very unspecific. An alternative hypothesis that \"the null hypothesis is false\" doesn't say much... we should wonder, \"how, specfically, is the null false?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "As an example really giving a demonstrating this, consider rejecting a null hypothesis that there is no correlation between rain and pizza's delivered. Such a decision doesn't specify what the actual hypothetical correlation might be. In fact, it doesn't even indicate if there are more or less pizzas delivered when it rains... \n",
