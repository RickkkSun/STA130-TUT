    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Imports**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries. `numpy` is used for numerical operations, and `matplotlib.pyplot` is used for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "data = np.random.randn(10000)  # Replace with your actual data\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Sample Data**: Here, `data` is generated as a random sample of 10,000 points from a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). In practice, this line should be replaced with your actual dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bootstrap parameters\n",
    "n_bootstraps = 10000\n",
    "bootstrap_means = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Parameters**: \n",
    "  - `n_bootstraps`: This variable defines the number of bootstrap samples to generate (10,000 in this case).\n",
    "  - `bootstrap_means`: An empty list is created to store the means of each bootstrap sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bootstrapping\n",
    "for _ in range(n_bootstraps):\n",
    "    bootstrap_sample = np.random.choice(data, size=1000, replace=True)\n",
    "    bootstrap_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping Loop**:\n",
    "  - The `for` loop runs `n_bootstraps` times. \n",
    "  - Inside the loop, a bootstrap sample is created by randomly selecting 1,000 data points from the original `data` array with replacement (`replace=True` means the same point can be selected multiple times).\n",
    "  - The mean of each bootstrap sample is calculated and appended to the `bootstrap_means` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate 95% confidence interval\n",
    "ci_lower = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)\n",
    "ci_upper = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval Calculation**:\n",
    "  - The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is calculated as the 2.5th percentile of the `bootstrap_means`.\n",
    "  - The upper limit is calculated as the 97.5th percentile. This means that we expect 95% of the bootstrap means to fall between these two percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Plotting\n",
    "plt.hist(bootstrap_means, bins=30, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Histogram**: A histogram of the bootstrap means is created with 30 bins. The edges of the bars are outlined in black (`edgecolor='k'`), and `alpha=0.7` makes the bars slightly transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.axvline(ci_lower, color='red', linestyle='--', label='2.5th Percentile (Lower CI)')\n",

    "```\n",
    "- **Vertical Lines**: \n",
    "  - Red dashed line (`axvline`) represents the lower confidence interval limit.\n",
    "  - Blue dashed line represents the upper confidence interval limit.\n",
    "  - A green solid line indicates the mean of the bootstrap means.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.title('Bootstrap Sample Means Histogram')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Bootstrap Means')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Frequency')\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Final Plot Formatting**: The plot is titled, axes are labeled, a legend is added, and finally, `plt.show()` displays the histogram with all the annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The entire code creates a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval for the mean of the data. It does this by generating many samples, calculating their means, and visualizing the distribution of these means along with the confidence interval limits. This method helps to assess the variability and reliability of the mean estimate from the original dataset."

    "\n",
    "In any analysis, especially in the context of evaluating the effectiveness of a vaccine, it’s crucial to consider various factors that could influence the findings. Here are some key considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of the Analysis\n",
    "1. Small Sample Size: The dataset includes only 10 patients, which may not adequately represent the broader population. Small sample sizes can lead to unreliable estimates and reduced statistical power, making it difficult to detect true effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of Control Group: Without a control group (e.g., a group that did not receive the vaccine), it’s challenging to determine whether the observed changes in health scores are due to the vaccine or other external factors, such as natural health fluctuations or other interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Short Time Frame: The data captures health scores only before and after vaccination without considering long-term effects. Health outcomes may evolve over time, and a longer follow-up period might reveal different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selection Bias: If the patients included in the study are not randomly selected, the results may be skewed. For instance, if healthier individuals were more likely to volunteer for the vaccine, the effectiveness might be overestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reporting Bias: Patients may subjectively report their health scores, leading to inconsistencies. Personal biases or expectations about the vaccine could influence how patients perceive their health changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Confounding Variables: Other factors, such as age, gender, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle choices, could impact health outcomes but are not accounted for in this analysis. These confounders could obscure the true relationship between the vaccine and health improvements."
