But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to ChatGPT: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Avoid Unnecessary Row Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "If you apply df.dropna() before removing a specific column (e.g., using del df['col']), rows with missing values in the column you intend to delete might be unnecessarily dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this scenario: If the column you plan to delete (col) contains missing values, df.dropna() would remove rows where those missing values exist. But since you’re going to delete the entire column, removing these rows beforehand would be unnecessary, as the column itself will not exist after deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved Data Retention\n",
    "By applying del df['col'] before df.dropna(), you first eliminate any irrelevant columns that may have missing data. This ensures that when you apply df.dropna(), the DataFrame is cleaned based only on the columns that are relevant for your analysis.\n",
    "In the above example, applying del df['Notes'] first ensures that df.dropna() doesn’t remove rows based on the Notes column, retaining as much valid data as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simplifies Data Cleaning Logic\n",
    "Deleting unnecessary columns before applying df.dropna() simplifies the data cleaning process. It ensures that only the relevant columns are considered for missing value handling, making your logic cleaner and more focused on the actual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance Considerations\n",
    "Removing irrelevant columns with del before cleaning data can improve performance. Since df.dropna() needs to check for missing values across all columns, reducing the number of columns first can speed up the operation, especially for large datasets.\n"

    "> This problem will guide you through exploring how to use a ChatBot to troubleshoot code using the \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv\" data set \n",
    "> \n",
    "> To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatBot, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from \"2\" above\n",
    "> - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the \"titanic\" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "    \n",
    "> If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",
